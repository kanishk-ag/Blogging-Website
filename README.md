# Blogging-Website
This contains a website created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery and PHP.
MYSQL is used for the database.
The users have to create an account after which they can sign in and write their own blogs or view blogs by other users.
The design is simple and to the point.
There is a database named "blog" which includes 3 tables "admin", "users" & "blogs".
The "admin" table includes 4 columns: "ID","Username","Password","Email".
The "users" table includes information about all the users and contains 9 columns: "ID","Name","Age","Gender","Email","Username","Password","Photo","Blocked".
The "blogs" table includes all the blogs by the users using 5 columns: "ID","Username","Title","Blog","Date".
The "Username" of "blogs" table refers to the "Username" of "users" table.


Any changes and updates are welcome.
